.NET Conf is a free, 3-day, virtual developer event organized by the .NET Foundation, Microsoft, and the .NET Community. This year .NET 5 launches at .NET Conf and weâ€™re celebrating the 10th anniversary of the virtual event with some very special guests! Over the course of the three days you have a wide selection of live sessions that feature speakers from the community and .NET team members. There are sessions streaming for 24 hours between day two and three of the conference so everyone can get involved no matter what their time zone. You can ask questions live on Twitter, join the fun on Twitch, attend the virtual attendee party where you can play trivia games and win prizes. Best of all, you can take what you learn here and be a better .NET developer.
